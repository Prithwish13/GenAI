Cricket is a globally popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players, with the objective of scoring more runs than the opposition. The game is played on an oval field centered around a 22-yard pitch with wickets at each end, and matches can span formats from five-day Test matches to fast-paced T20 games.[1][2][3]

## Overview and Objectives
Cricket is a team sport contested by two sides of eleven players, where one team bats to score runs while the other bowls and fields to restrict scoring and dismiss batters. The batting team aims to accumulate runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, or by striking boundariesâ€”four runs if the ball reaches the boundary after touching the ground, and six if it clears the boundary on the fly. The team with the higher total at the end of the match wins. If the time allotted expires without a result in multi-innings matches, the game is declared a draw. The sport is governed internationally by the International Cricket Council (ICC), while the Laws of Cricket are maintained by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[2][3][1]

## Historical Development
Cricket originated in south-east England during the medieval period, with the first definite reference dating to 1597 in Surrey, where it was played by schoolboys. The game evolved into a formal adult sport by the 17th century, with the first written laws established in 1744. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787, became the custodian of the Laws and remains central to the sport's governance. The first international match took place in 1844 between teams from the United States and Canada, while the first Test match was played in 1877 between England and Australia, marking the birth of 'The Ashes' rivalry.[4][3][1][2]

## Rules and Gameplay
A cricket match is divided into innings, with two batters on the field at a time. The bowler delivers the ball from one end of the pitch, aiming to hit the wicket or get the batter out. Runs are scored when batters safely cross and touch the ground behind the opposite popping crease. The innings ends when ten batters are dismissed, a condition known as being "all out". Key methods of dismissal include being bowled, caught, leg before wicket (lbw), run out, and stumped. The team captain wins a coin toss to decide whether to bat or field first, setting the strategic tone for the match.[1][2]

## Equipment and Protective Gear
The cricket bat is traditionally made of willow wood, with a maximum width of 4.25 inches and length of 38 inches. The ball is a hard leather sphere with a stitched seam, weighing between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces. Red balls are used in Test cricket, while white balls are standard in limited overs matches, especially under floodlights. Batters and wicket-keepers wear protective equipment, including padded gloves, leg guards (pads), helmets, and abdominal guards (boxes), to mitigate injury from fast deliveries exceeding 90 mph.[2][1]

## Formats and Competitions
Cricket features multiple formats tailored to different durations and audiences:
- **Test Cricket**: The longest format, played over five days with two innings per side, considered the pinnacle of the sport.
- **One Day Internationals (ODI)**: Limited to 50 overs per innings, completed in a single day, with the ICC Cricket World Cup held every four years since 1975.
- **Twenty20 (T20)**: A fast-paced format with 20 overs per innings, lasting about three hours, popularized by franchise leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL).
- **Emerging Formats**: Include T10 (ten-over games), The Hundred (100 balls per innings), and adaptations for multi-sport events such as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.[3][2]

Women's cricket has grown significantly, with major tournaments like the Women's Cricket World Cup (first held in 1973) and the Women's T20 World Cup (inaugurated in 2009). Domestic competitions such as the Ranji Trophy (India), County Championship (England), and Sheffield Shield (Australia) sustain the sport at the national level.[5][2]
